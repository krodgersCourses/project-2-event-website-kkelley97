        <h2>From Field to Feed</h2>
        <p>Silage is livestock feed. It is the process of preserving grains and stocks with moisture in them for
          the livestock animal to eat throug the winter. In the summer crops consists of tritacale, a three way mix, or
          hay.
          Other plants can also be silaged like turnip tops. The object of preserving silage is the removal of oxygen.
          The equiptment needed to complete the Hamar job is a swather, chopper, trucks, and pack tractor.

        <h2>In the Chopper Seat</h2>
        <p>Every July we go to Hamar to chop siliage. On this farm/ranch the silage will feed sheep and cows. Our
          fearless leader and
          chopper driver is Dave. His partner is Steve. Don't forget Dave's wife, Michelle. Dave hires a crew when its
          time to chop, and has
          found along with men, women are great drivers and workers.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>There is a process to make silage. First, because we are making a grain type silage, the crop needs to be
          swathed. Next, it dries
          until it reaches the moisture level of 68%. Then the chopper picks up the windrows up, and runs it through the
          chopper. It is
          chopped into little pieces and spit into a silage truck. The truck takes it to the pit where it is unloaded.
          The pack tractor is next;
          it piles and packs the silage to remove the oxygen. The better the pack, the better the silage. After the job
          is done the pile
          is covered to keep oxygen and weather out.
