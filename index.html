          <h2>From Field to Feed</h2>
          <p>Silage is livestock feed. It is the process of preserving grains and stocks that have moisture in them for 
            the livestock animal to eat throug the winter. In the summer is consists of tritacale, a three way mix, or hay.
            Other plants can also be silaged like turnip tops. The object of preserving silage is the removal of oxygen. 
            The equiptment needed to complete the Hamar job is a swather, chopper, trucks, and pack tractor.

          <h2>In the Chopper Seat</h2>
          <p>Every July we go to Hamar to chop siliage. On this farm/ranch the silage will feed sheep and cows. Our fearless leader and 
            chopper driver is Dave and his wife Michelle. His partner is Steve. From there Dave hires family and has found women make 
            great drivers and workers.

          <h2>The Process</h2>
          <p>There is a process to make silage, fist because we are making a grain type silage the crop needs to be swathed. Next, it dries 
            until it reaches the moisture level of 68%. Then the chopper picks up the windrows up, runs it through the chopper where it is chopped
             into little pieces and spits it into a silage truck. The truck takes it to the pit where it is unloaded from the truck and a pack 
             tractor piles and packs the silage to remove the oxygen. The better the pack, the better the silage. After the job is done the pile 
             covered to keep oxygen and weather out.
